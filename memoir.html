              <h2>MEMOIR</h2>
                <p class="baskerville-small"> It’s crazy how, at 22, I watched Sex and the City and dreamed of having their life, thinking it would never happen for me. But they weren’t 22 — not even in season one. And now, 10 years later, as I find myself in Carrie’s luxurious age of 32 from season one, I’ve realized it’s even better than I imagined. Worth the wait.

We have this ridiculously cool and carefree life. We have good friends, long nights, expensive soaps, sweaty backs from sex and workouts and dancing. We have a fueled car for weekend getaways and a wine cooler for picnics in the park. We have chosen our family. We have yet to discover our favourite restaurant. We can handle technology and worship the classics. We can travel the world and cuddle at home. We can have too much wine, but never too much pasta. We can laugh our asses off, and we will be good at crying when the time comes.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p class="baskerville-small">Für Mama (Deutsch)</p>
                <br>
                <p class="baskerville-small">Es ist verrückt: Mit 22 habe ich Sex and the City geschaut und davon geträumt, so ein Leben zu führen – und dachte, es würde für mich nie passieren. Aber sie waren damals gar nicht 22 – nicht einmal in der ersten Staffel. Und jetzt, 10 Jahre später, im „luxuriösen Carrie-Alter“ von 32 aus Staffel eins, merke ich: Es ist sogar noch besser, als ich es mir ausgemalt habe. Das Warten hat sich gelohnt.

Wir führen dieses lächerlich coole, unbeschwerte Leben. Wir haben gute Freunde, lange Nächte, teure Seifen, verschwitzte Rücken vom Sex, vom Sport und vom Tanzen. Wir haben ein vollgetanktes Auto für Wochenendausflüge und einen Weinkühler für Picknicks im Park. Wir haben unsere Familie selbst gewählt. Unser Lieblingsrestaurant müssen wir noch finden. Wir können mit Technik umgehen und die Klassiker verehren. Wir können um die Welt reisen und zu Hause kuscheln. Wir können zu viel Wein trinken, aber niemals zu viel Pasta essen. Wir können uns kaputtlachen – und wir werden gut im Weinen sein, wenn es so weit ist.</p>

                <h2>JUNI 2018 DRAMEN </h2>
                <p class="baskerville-small">Das beste Drama spiele ich immer noch vor mir selbst. Filmreif lehne ich mich gegen die Bank und blicke vom Hügel über die Stadt in die beinahe untergegangene Sonne. Die Hitze des Tages bricht, kühlere Luft streift über meine Haut, Gänsehaut wandert über meine Arme. Ich nehme einen Schluck Rotwein. Schritte auf dem Gras hinter mir. Die Musik der Party ist nur noch ein dumpfer Rest, das Zirpen der Grillen im Vordergrund.
<br> „Hier bist du also“, sagt er und setzt sich auf die Lehne der Bank.„Wieso bist du hier? Die Party ist da oben.“ <br> „Hm. Nur kurz allein sein.“ <br> „Darf ich trotzdem?“ Er zündet sich eine Zigarette an. Schwarze Jeans, weiße Sneaker, beige vom Staub. Er lehnt sich neben mich, bläst Rauch aus.
„Das könnten wir sein.“ <br> „Wir?“<br> „Na, einer von uns könnte der nächste sein, der einen Garten kauft und mit seinen Kindern Frisbee spielt.“ <br> Ich weiß genau, was ich denke, aber ich höre lieber nicht hin.„Ja. Stimmt. Irgendwann.“
Ich fröstele und gebe ihm das Glas, reibe mir die Arme, als würde ich mich selbst umarmen. Wir lächeln uns an.„Willst du meine Jacke?“ Er stellt das Glas auf die Bank und legt er mir seine Jeansjacke über die Schultern. Sie riecht nach ihm, nach Nachtluft, nach all den Abenden, an denen er mir schon eine Jacke gegeben hat. Als wir anders waren. In meinem Bauch wird alles schwer. Ich drehe mich zu ihm um, halte den Stoff fest, als wäre es das Einzige, was von ihm bleibt.
Er sitzt einfach da, schmunzelt. Zwischen uns liegt so viel Zeit, verstreut wie Pusteblumen-Samen im Wind. Seine Hand fährt durch meine Haare, zieht mein Gesicht näher. Einen Moment lang verharrt er so, als würde er warten, dass ich ihn wegstoße, aber ich bewege mich nicht.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>OKTOBER 2018 PATZER</h2>
                <p class="baskerville-small">We first saw each other a couple of weeks ago. He smiled and said hi, and something immediately stirred inside me. I hadn’t thought about another guy for what felt like ages. He has such a soft voice, deep and gentle. He makes mistakes when he talks — grammar slips, sometimes he doesn’t find the right words. It’s sweet. He impresses me; he’s clever. He doesn’t give a damn what people think, unlike me, who worries endlessly about what people might think of her. Whether they like me. Nowadays, whether he likes me...

We were drunk out partying the first time I noticed that he saw me too. A friend from work took me shopping; we bought dresses. I picked mine with him in mind. We exchanged a few texts — “Meet us there,” a couple more friends. Hopeful and slightly tipsy, he was there too — at least not sober, who knows. We went for a round at the bar, some wine, some beers. We toasted; his gaze shot into my eyes. I felt warmth crawling up my neck. I wanted something to happen. I never know what I expect to happen, just that I want to be the only one. To feel wanted.

We danced, talked to other people, to our friends, to each other. And I don’t remember the circumstances, but all of a sudden, he stood in front of me. Grabbed my hand, pulled me a little closer, and started to move, as if we were just friends, giggly and dancing. I was way too confused and by that point way too drunk as well. We stood there, moving for a few minutes (or more?), and I tried to get even closer, his shoulders touching my nose. No particular smell, just the club, the smoke and something thrilling. The closest we got was when he pulled my hair and curled it between his fingers for a second. It went so quickly I couldn’t even comprehend it. And off he was again, pointing with the same fingers towards the bar.

I nodded and we moved away from the group, heading to the bar. I was in front; he grabbed my neck gently and pushed me, with an unfamiliar softness. I liked it. I wanted to turn around and kiss him; he probably wouldn’t have let me anyway, but I shied away. I let him order me some more wine. We toasted; I looked into those deep, gloomy eyes, my stomach turned. It was just the wine, and of course my urge to feel wanted. To feel loved. It hurts, never to be satisfied. Like that night, when we parted, just a quick hug, buzzing in my stomach, I had to go home.</p>

                <h2>MODERN LOVE</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="baskerville-small"> Manchmal fühlt sich Liebe an wie das Meer: weit, unberechenbar, manchmal stürmisch, manchmal sanft. „An Ocean Away“ ist eine Geschichte über diese Art von Liebe – über das Driften zwischen Nähe und Distanz, über Erinnerungen, die nicht vergehen, und über Momente, die uns ein Leben lang unter die Haut gehen. Diese Geschichte habe ich ursprünglich für die Modern Love Kolumne im Juni 2022 geschrieben, dort wurde sie nie veröffentlicht, deshalb teile ich sie jetzt hier im Original und auf Deutsch (für Mutti).</p>
                <br>
                <h3>An Ocean Away</h3>
                <p class="baskerville-small">He just sent me a friend request on Instagram. Some things really do never change.
Fourteen-year-old me would have been amazed at how easily you could stalk someone. Back then, we only had student platforms to post the occasional school trip photo—which I would zoom in on for hours, marvelling at his blond curls in three pixels.
He was my summer crush, a friend of a friend’s older brother. He played the drums at my music school; I took piano lessons. Once, in the hallway, I dared to ask him out for ice cream. He politely declined and I cried for weeks. Yet even waves of tears never washed away the memory of those first butterflies.
<br>
When Facebook came along, he was dating a girl younger than me. She was all over his profile. Selfies and everything. So you can understand my confusion when I found a friend request from him, along with a message asking me out. I assumed they had broken up and that he wasn’t the type to erase all social media evidence immediately. Excited that he remembered I liked him all those years ago, I agreed to a date straight away and spent the rest of the day poring over his photo albums.

But nothing in those pictures compared to the guy who picked me up a few days later: taller, a little lanky, his sandy curls cut short and spiked with wax, velvet brown eyes launching a storm inside me.
<br>
He was cheeky, and he took me out for ice cream. The date turned out to be the kind that makes your head spin—from talking, adrenaline, and sugar, but also because he was charming and funny. The memory of His voice rolled over me like sunlit waves. After our hug goodbye, I couldn’t help but feel again and again where his skin had touched mine, as if to remind myself that it was real. I fell in love with him again, I fell in love with him again, like a tide pulling me under.

A few days later, my heart was pulled under again when he told me they hadn’t broken up, that he was looking for a fling. Real-time cheating. Asking me to be his secret. Telling me he liked me. Flooding me with right-or-wrong thoughts, yet eventually drowning me in him with a single, simple kiss.
<br>
I had barely dated before. Sex in the backseat of a car amongst the first few times I ever did it was unexpected and thrilling, illicit — but I didn’t care. I got selfish- and as long as I got to spend time with him, I didn’t mind sneaking around in awkward situations. I preferred the intimacy of late nights lying in my bed for hours, staring at the stars through my skylight or sometimes just at each other, talking about the big and small things in life, carefully avoiding the elephant in the room. Occasionally, I thought about the other girl and how he acted with her—whether he made her laugh, curled her hair between his fingers, collapsed into her when he came, his chest on hers so she could feel his heart racing and his whole body tremble while he said her name. 

At first, we met once a week. Then he stayed over more often. We shared mixtapes, nights, whispered intimacy, he once even manoeuvred a meeting with my dad. But our relationship was hidden. I couldn’t tell friends, post photos, claim him. When his girlfriend found out, he vanished from my texts. That could have been the end. I tried dating others, secretly hoping he’d return. And he did.
<br>
As I left our hometown our universities only were an hour apart and we finally didn’t need to hide. But we barely went out. Days blurred: sex, music, all-night talks. I searched for in other dates what he gave me effortlessly, but it was never the same. They always fell short of the high he set.

One day, he was waiting on my doorstep as I was about to go out with friends. He looked out of it and told me they had broken up, that he was finally single. Something new for him. We decided to try something new for both of us and went out together. He joined me at the party, and I enjoyed having him by my side, people asking me about my “boyfriend,” him kissing me in front of everyone. That night, drunk and full of adrenaline from his affection, I simply told him I loved him. I knew I felt it but would never have dared to say it sober. “Then let’s get married,” he replied. We made a ring out of a hair tie. I still wore it the next morning, waking to the smell of him on his side of the bed—but he was gone. We never spoke of it again.

<br>
For years, we met over Christmas: a pint, a backseat shag, a ritual of intimacy. The year after he proposed, he cancelled that date— of course, he had a new girlfriend—and it hit me hard. Not just because she wasn’t me, but because I’d just been cheated on myself. On some level, I felt I deserved it—I had been the “other” girl for so long. I wanted to blame him, vent my anger at him for making it impossible for me to find someone else, because I always went for guys who treated me the way he did, since it was all I’d ever known.

Anger, betrayal, and yet that old familiarity surged the moment he stepped through my door months later. His hazel eyes, his breath, the sense of home. Forgiveness.

Details blurred over time, all but one. Morning light, the smell of buttered toast and coffee drifting like fog over calm waters, and the news that he wouldn’t visit so freely anymore—his new girlfriend pregnant. The last time, truly, we saw each other like that. Distance became a current I could finally swim against. I realised then that, subconsciously, his multiple partners gave him security. While I collected the moments that made him my harbour, I was only ever his lifebelt.
<br>
 recently saw him during a visit to our hometown. I was drifting between the aisles of a drugstore with my mum when she spotted him first. Then I saw him, with his wife and children. She had the same haircut and round glasses as me —a mirror I hadn’t expected to see. No one said a word.

I have always belonged to water, where currents carry me and waves cradle my small fears. The ocean alone can make me happy. But to love something so vast, indifferent, unstoppable, is terrifying. Comfort comes in the knowledge that even in the deepest tide, I can find the surface again.
